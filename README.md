<h1>Sorting Agorithms using Python</h1>
<h3>1.Bubble Sort:</h3><i><h2>Code is also there!</h2></i><p> Bubble Sort means finding the largest element first. For example:

I have an list of size 5:
list = [8,7,5,4,1]
</p>
Here My first step will be finding the first largest element so,

<p>(i) comparison and swap (8 compared to the next element if 8 is bigger than next element then we will swap with next number so after some iterations, what wil I get
 [7,5,4,1,8] <br>
(ii) Using same function I get my final sorted list.
</p>

<h3>2.Selection Sort:</h3><i><h2>Code is also there!</h2></i> <p>In selection sort we start by initializing a minimum variable which has a value of first index.
(i) compare the all values with min variable and when we finish compairing after that we swap first index value with min index value.

For example:
list = [7,5,4,2,1]
min = 0
Then we compares the value with next index 5 so 5 is smaller than the value which at min index so we change our min index to 1. Same as our min index change to 4.
And atlast we swap the value 7 with min index.
 </p>
