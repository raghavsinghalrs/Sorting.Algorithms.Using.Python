<h1>Sorting Agorithms using Python</h1>
<h3>1.Bubble Sort:</h3><i><h2>Code is also there!</h2></i><p> Bubble Sort means finding the largest element first. For example:

I have an list of size 5:
list = [8,7,5,4,1]
</p>
Here My first step will be finding the first largest element so,

<p>(i) comparison and swap (8 compared to the next element if 8 is bigger than next element then we will swap with next number so after some iterations, what wil I get
 [7,5,4,1,8] <br>
(ii) Using same function I get my final sorted list.
</p>

<h3>2.Selection Sort:</h3><i><h2>Code is also there!</h2></i> <p>In selection sort we start by initializing a minimum variable which has a value of first index.
(i) compare the all values with min variable and when we finish compairing after that we swap first index value with min index value.

For example:
list = [7,5,4,2,1]
min = 0
Then we compares the value with next index 5 so 5 is smaller than the value which at min index so we change our min index to 1. Same as our min index change to 4.
And atlast we swap the value 7 with min index.
 </p>
<h3>3.Insertion Sort:</h3><i><h2>Code is also there!</h2></i><p>In insertion what we do we iterate the elements from index1 and check to previous elements like if previous element is greater than the element at current index, then it will swap with that value. For example:

I have an list of size 5:
list = [7,5,4,2,1]
</p>
<p>(i) Start with index 1 means value 5 it compares the value which is at previous index 7.<br>
(ii) So 7 is greater than 5 , then it will swap the value. Using same way we will get our sorted list.
</p>
