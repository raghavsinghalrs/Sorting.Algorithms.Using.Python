Sorting Agorithms using Python:

1. Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort means finding the largest element first. For example:

I have an list of size 5:
list = [8,7,5,4,1]

Here My first step will be finding the first largest element so,

(i) comparison and swap (8 compared to the next element if 8 is bigger than next element then we will swap with next number so after some iterations, what wil I get
 [7,5,4,1,8] <br>
(ii) Using same function I get my final sorted list.

Code is also there!

2. Selection Sort: In selection sort we start by initializing a minimum variable which has a value of first index.
(i) compare the all values with min variable and when we finish compairing after that we swap first index value with min index value.

For example:
list = [7,5,4,2,1]
min = 0
Then we compares the value with next index 5 so 5 is smaller than the value which at min index so we change our min index to 1. Same as our min index change to 4.
And atlast we swap the value 7 with min index.
