<b><h2>Sorting Agorithms using Python </h2></b>

1. Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort means finding the largest element first. For example:

I have an list of size 5:
list = [8,7,5,4,1]

Here My first step will be finding the first largest element so,

(i) comparison and swap (8 compared to the next element if 8 is bigger than next element then we will swap with next number so after some iterations, what wil I get
 [7,5,4,1,8]
(ii) Using same function I get my final sorted list.
